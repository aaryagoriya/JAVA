## What You'll Find

This repository contains a wide range of beginner-friendly Java examples organized by topic. Each section explores the essential concepts that form the building blocks of Java programming:

### Basic Syntax

- **`System.out.println()`**: The most common method for printing output to the console.
- **Comments**: Explanation of single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments for better code readability and documentation.

**Example**:  
```java
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is a multi-line comment 
   that spans multiple lines. */
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
